# Stopwatch

## Converts one unit to other units

A stopwatch is a tool that is used to measure the amount of time that elapses between the start and stop of an event. It is commonly used in sports to time races or other events where precise timing is important. A stopwatch can also be used for timing experiments or other activities where accurate timing is crucial. A timer, on the other hand, is a tool that is used to set a specific amount of time for an activity. It is commonly used in cooking to time the cooking of food or in other situations where a specific amount of time needs to be tracked. Timers can be set for any amount of time, from seconds to hours, and can be set to sound an alarm when the time has elapsed.
